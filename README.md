# PyFlask

A workshop organised by [ACM VIT](https:/acmvit.in) every year, during [Gravitas](http://www.vit.ac.in/files/gravitas18/home.html) (VIT University, Tech Fest). Before today, This workshop was ***PyGAE***, which included sessions on **Python Programming** and Creating Website Using **Google App Engine**, This time session was on Creating Website Using **Flask** (A light weight **Python** framework). 

## What is ACM VIT?

ACM VIT Student Chapter, a student organization which takes pride in conducting workshops for the student community, Helping the underprivileged, by collaborating with local organizational bodies in and around Vellore, to give them a head start with technology.

Currently, We are also working with various projects with a vision to help the society, We will soon be launching some of these, once we are done with alpha testing.

If you are looking to contribute or have any project idea which requires guidance and a team, Feel free to drop an email tech@vit.acm.org

## Why This Repository?

Motive of this repository is to have a centralized way to access **PyFlask 2k18** materials, which may serve as a reference during and after the workshop.
