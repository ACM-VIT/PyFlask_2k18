# INPUT

## What is input?

Input is used to read data from user.

## How to take input?

There are two functions in Python that you can use to read data from the user:
raw_input() and input()
input() is used to read integers.
raw_input() is used to read text(strings) from the user.

You can store the results from them into a variable.

## Syntax

x=input()
y=raw_input()

## Examples

num=input("Enter a number: ")

name=raw_input("Enter your name: ")
