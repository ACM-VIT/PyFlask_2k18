# Basics

Python is a general-purpose language. It has wide range of applications from Web development , scientific and mathematical computing  to desktop graphical user Interfaces.

Python is a powerful high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum.

The syntax of the language is clean and length of the code is relatively short. It's fun to work in Python because it allows you to think about the problem rather than focusing on the syntax.

## Reasons to Choose Python as First Language

  * Simple Elegant Syntax

  Programming in Python is fun. It's easier to understand and write Python code.

  * Not overly strict

  You don't need to define the type of a variable in Python. Also, it's not necessary to add semicolon at the end of the statement.

  Python enforces you to follow good practices (like proper indentation). These small things can make learning much easier for beginners

  * Great Community and Support

  Python has a large supporting community. There are numerous active forums online which can be handy if you are stuck.

## Basics comprises of the following

  * [Input](./input.md)
    * Input is used to read data from user. You call this function to tell the program to stop and wait for the user to key in the data.

  * [Print](./print.md)
    *   The print() function prints the given object to the standard output device (screen) or to the text stream file.
    
  * [Variables](./variables.md)
    * In programming, variables can be used to store numbers, decimal numbers, results of arithmetic operations, words or sentences. In some programming languages, you do not need to specify what kind of value can be stored in a variable where as in some you must.
