# if - else

Before we get into this we need to know about decision making.

Decision making is the anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.

Decision making structures evaluate single or multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.

Python programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as TRUE, and if it is either zero or null, then it is assumed as FALSE value.

Breakdown of decision making statements in the Python programming:

| **Sr.No.** | **Statements &amp; Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 1          | [**if** statements](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_if_statement.htm) - An _if_ statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.                                                                   |
| 2          | [**if...else** statements](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_if_else.htm) - An _if_ statement can be followed by an optional _else_ statement, which executes when the boolean expression is FALSE.                                |
| 3          | [**elif** statements](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_if_else.htm) - You can have an _elif_ statement to check for another boolean expression and execute that if the boolean expression with the _elif_ is TRUE and the is true |
